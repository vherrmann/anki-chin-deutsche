The deck in data/ differs from the [[https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2485307055][original]] in the following ways:
- additional fields have been added ("Audio", "Beispielsatz Chinesisch", "Beispielsatz Pinyin", "Beispielsatz Ãœbersetzung")
- one of the notes had a html tag in it's "Chinese" field. This broke the scripts wherefore it was removed.
- a third card has been added to the note type (fitting to the templates)
