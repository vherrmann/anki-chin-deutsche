Before using the scripts create-simp.py or create-trad.py you first have to add the needed fields ("Audio", "Beispielsatz", "Beispielsatz Ãœbersetzung") to the deck. In our case we need an additional field for the audio and an additional field for the sentence.
After using create-simp.py or create-trad.py you still need to paste the frontside and backside from ./card to its corresponding card.
Change the following options:
- The daily limits should be divisible by 3, e.g. 15 instead of 20
- New card sort order should be "Order gathered"
- New/review order should be "Show after reviews"
