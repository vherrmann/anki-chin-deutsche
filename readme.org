The deck in data/ differs from the [[https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2485307055][original]] in the following ways:
- additional fields have been added ("Audio", "Beispielsatz Chinesisch", "Beispielsatz Pinyin", "Beispielsatz Ãœbersetzung")
- one of the notes had a html tag in it's "Chinese" field. This broke the scripts wherefore it was removed.
- a third card has been added to the note type (fitting to the templates)

I recommend using the following options:
- The daily limits should be divisible by 3, e.g. 15 instead of 20
- New card sort order should be "Order gathered" so that you get the three cards of a new note together.
- New/review order should be "Show after reviews" so that you know when you learn new cards.
